# TrackShippingContainers
This is an app that will keep track of shipping containers and their contents using their RFIDs, and the concept of an IOT using Java.

I did this project as a part of an assignment for the course, SYSC2004, taught at Carleton University. It allowed me to demonstrate my understanding of:


- Input/output in Java
- Defining classes (attributes and methods) and creating objects of a classes
- Inheritance/Polymorphism
- Access specifiers
- LinkedLists and ArrayLists
- Converting UML diagram into applications
